# Survey Evaluation Project
This project contains three Python scripts designed to implement a simple neural network, detect and extract checkboxes from survey sheets, and evaluate survey forms.

# Files
Neural_Network.py: Implements a simple neural network from scratch.
Checkbox_Finder.py: Detects and extracts checkboxes from a survey sheet.
EvaluationHelper.py: Uses the other Neural_Network and Checkbox_Finder modules to evaluate multiple survey forms. It returns the mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum of the answers of each question.
